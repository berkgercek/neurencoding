What is Brainbox?
-----------------

Brainbox is a suite of simple tools for analyzing spike-sorted
electrophysiological data.

With brainbox we aim to provide a useful set of functions for analyzing data
that take simple inputs (lists, arrays, etc.) and provide simple outputs of
similar form. Brainbox includes tools for analyzing single units and
populations of neurons, as well as many useful plotting functions.

Brainbox is a work in progress. If you would like to contribute, please visit our `GitHub page <https://github.com/int-brain-lab/ibllib/blob/brainbox/brainbox/CONTRIBUTING.md]>`_!
